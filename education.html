        <h3> My education journey</h3>
        <br/>
        <div id="education"> First of all I would like to start off with my education. I began my education at the elementary school <a href="http://oulazoangelovski.com.mk/"> "Lazo Angelovski" </a>, continuing to my high school education at <a href="https://rjk.edu.mk/"> "Rade Jovcevski-Korcagin" </a>, graduating with a 5/5 GPA.
            I also enjoyed doing some extracurricular activites like acting in our high school drama club and representing our school at the School Orchestra. I did all these activities so that I could leave my mark on the school I so dearly enjoyed for generations to come.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Currently I am in my first year of studies at the <a href="http://www.ukim.edu.mk/en_index.php"> "University of Ss. Cyril and Methodius" </a>,
            more specifically at the <a href="https://www.finki.ukim.mk/en"> "Faculty of Computer Science & Engineering"</a>,
            where my studies are focused on Software engineering and information systems.
            I am looking forward to learning and developing new skills in the field of computer science and programming,
            alongside with Web Design & Development, programing languages and so on. My main goal is to use all the resources that my faculty offers, in order to gain knowledge and expertise.
